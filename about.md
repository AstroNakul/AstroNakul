I'm an ambitious astronomer, pursuing my undergraduate degree in Physics and Astronomy at York University, Toronto. I'm passionate about planetary science, especially analysing the atmospheric composition of the exoplanets and determining the possibility of habitability. My strong desire towards observational astronomy encouraged me to work at the Allan. I Carswell observatory at York Univerisity, which houses the 1m telescope. I'm a certified 1m telescope observer at the observatory and I took part in many astronomical outreachs hosted by the observatory team. I worked under Professor Boukar√© on the project "Geodynamics Simulation of Earth's Early Mantle Formation" during the summer of 2024.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy listening to music, travelling and astrophotography during my free time.
