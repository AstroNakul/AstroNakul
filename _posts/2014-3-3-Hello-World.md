PHYS 3130 project - Instructor: Elaina Hyde.

COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion of a M3 dwarf [(Zhang et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939). The planet was directly imaged using the FLAMINGOS-2 spectrograph on the 8.1 Gemini-South telescope in Chile [(Zhang et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939). The data obtained through [NASA’s exoplanets archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu) consists of 2000 data points of central wavelength (microns), spectral flux density as a function of wavelength (Fλ) (W/m2 microns), spectra flux density as a function of frequency (Fν) (Jy), positive and the negative errors of spectral flux density as a function of wavelength (W/m2 micron) and spectral flux density as a function of frequency (Jy), Observation date (days) and observation date errors (days). 

Central wavelength (microns) data represents the range of photons absorbed or emitted by the atmosphere. Spectral flux density as a function of wavelength (W/m2 microns) data represents the number of photons received at different wavelengths. The data of central wavelength and the Spectral flux density as a function of wavelength is a 1D continuous variable because it consists of a single independent variable, and the values depend on any real number within the range. Line plots and scatter plots are the best plots to represent the central wavelength vs spectral flux graph, but line plots are used for this project as they are legible and consistent compared to scatter plots. The peaks in the plot will tell us that the absorption is high at that wavelength, and the molecular absorption at that wavelength can be determined using the molecular absorption data. The histogram plot can be used to understand the distribution of Spectral 5 Flux Density as a function of wavelength (W/m2 microns), as shown in Figure 2. The mean of the Spectral Flux is calculated to be 1.18 x10-17 (W/m2 microns) and the variance is calculated to be 9.9 x 10-34 (W/m2 microns). The skewness of the distribution of the Flux is 0, which indicates that the distribution is normalized.

Zhang et al (2024) is a good source to know more about the data, as it gives a detailed overview of the observation and results on the spectral data.
